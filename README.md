## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was my first completely independent project outside of my bootcamp courses, I had to work through exactly how I wanted to breakdown this project and it only made sense to start with the html. Through this once I moved to the css next it was easy to understand why planning ahead and making clear classes at the same time as writing html is a lot more useful than having to go back and forth to put them in later. When trying to figure out how to resize a container I was using the padding element and that of course was not correct, which led me to searching it up on MDN Web Docs.

### Continued development

Moving forward I would like to just work on more projects to perfect my process and find a layout that I like using. I would definitely like to work more with custom css properties and design features. Also this project vwas my first time using Github so I would like to expand on my knowledge on that platform as well since I can see how useful it is when sharing code in teams.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS) - When I hit a wall with how to resize a container in order to make my design match the original, I visited this site to help me understand. Everything was explained in plain english and also in code, I highly recommend this resource to anyone having issues.
